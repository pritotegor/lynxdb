description: How to create, configure, test, and manage SPL2-powered alerts with multi-channel notifications in LynxDB.

# Set Up Alerts

LynxDB alerts evaluate an SPL2 query on a schedule and send notifications when the query returns results. Use alerts to detect error spikes, latency anomalies, missing heartbeats, or any condition you can express in SPL2.

## How alerts work

1. You define an SPL2 query that returns results when a problem is detected.
2. LynxDB evaluates the query at a configurable interval (for example, every 5 minutes).
3. If the query returns one or more results, LynxDB sends notifications to all configured channels.

The alert query should produce results only when the alert condition is met. Typically this means aggregating events and filtering with `WHERE`.

---

## Create an alert via the CLI

Use [`lynxdb alerts create`](/docs/cli/alerts):

```bash
lynxdb alerts create \
  --name "High error rate" \
  --query 'level=error | stats count AS errors | where errors > 100' \
  --interval 5m
```

This checks every 5 minutes whether the error count exceeds 100 in the evaluation window.

---

## Create an alert via the REST API

Use [`POST /api/v1/alerts`](/docs/api/alerts):

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:3100/api/v1/alerts -d '{
  "name": "High error rate",
  "q": "level=error | stats count as errors | where errors > 100",
  "interval": "5m",
  "channels": [
    {"type": "slack", "config": {"webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00/B00/xxx"}}
  ]
}'
```

---

## Configure notification channels

Alerts support 8 notification channel types. Each alert can have multiple channels.

### Slack

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:3100/api/v1/alerts -d '{
  "name": "5xx spike",
  "q": "source=nginx status>=500 | stats count AS errors | where errors > 50",
  "interval": "5m",
  "channels": [
    {
      "type": "slack",
      "config": {
        "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00/B00/xxx"
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Telegram

```json
{
  "type": "telegram",
  "config": {
    "bot_token": "123456:ABC-DEF...",
    "chat_id": "-1001234567890"
  }
}
```

### PagerDuty

```json
{
  "type": "pagerduty",
  "config": {
    "routing_key": "your-integration-key",
    "severity": "critical"
  }
}
```

### OpsGenie

```json
{
  "type": "opsgenie",
  "config": {
    "api_key": "your-opsgenie-api-key",
    "priority": "P1"
  }
}
```

### Email

```json
{
  "type": "email",
  "config": {
    "to": "oncall@company.com",
    "subject": "LynxDB Alert: {{.Name}}"
  }
}
```

### Webhook (generic HTTP)

```json
{
  "type": "webhook",
  "config": {
    "url": "https://your-service.com/webhook",
    "method": "POST"
  }
}
```

### incident.io

```json
{
  "type": "incidentio",
  "config": {
    "api_key": "your-incidentio-key"
  }
}
```

### Multiple channels on one alert

Combine channels for redundancy:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:3100/api/v1/alerts -d '{
  "name": "Critical error rate",
  "q": "level=error | stats count as errors | where errors > 500",
  "interval": "5m",
  "channels": [
    {"type": "slack", "config": {"webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/..."}},
    {"type": "pagerduty", "config": {"routing_key": "...", "severity": "critical"}},
    {"type": "email", "config": {"to": "oncall@company.com"}}
  ]
}'
```

### CLI shorthand for channels

The CLI supports a shorthand syntax for adding channels:

```bash
lynxdb alerts create \
  --name "Error rate spike" \
  --query 'level=error | stats count as errors | where errors > 100' \
  --interval 5m \
  --channel slack:webhook_url=https://hooks.slack.com/... \
  --channel pagerduty:routing_key=...,severity=critical
```

---

## Test an alert

### Dry-run the query

Test alert evaluation without sending any notifications:

```bash
lynxdb alerts test <alert_id>
```

This runs the alert query and shows what results it would produce. Use this to verify your query logic before enabling the alert.

### Test notification channels

Send a test notification to all configured channels to verify connectivity:

```bash
lynxdb alerts test-channels <alert_id>
```

---

## Manage alerts

### List all alerts

```bash
lynxdb alerts
```

Or via the API:

```bash
curl -s localhost:3100/api/v1/alerts | jq .
```

### View alert details

```bash
lynxdb alerts <alert_id>
```

### Enable and disable

```bash
lynxdb alerts enable <alert_id>
lynxdb alerts disable <alert_id>
```

### Delete an alert

```bash
lynxdb alerts delete <alert_id>
lynxdb alerts delete <alert_id> --force   # skip confirmation
```

---

## Alert query patterns

### Error rate above threshold

```spl
level=error | stats count AS errors | where errors > 100
```

### Error rate as a percentage

```spl
source=nginx
  | stats count AS total, count(eval(status>=500)) AS errors
  | eval error_pct = round(errors/total*100, 1)
  | where error_pct > 5
```

### Latency spike

```spl
source=nginx
  | stats perc99(duration_ms) AS p99
  | where p99 > 2000
```

### Missing heartbeat (no events from a source)

```spl
source=health-check
  | stats count
  | where count = 0
```

### High error rate per service

```spl
level=error
  | stats count AS errors by service
  | where errors > 50
```

### Security: failed login brute force

```spl
source=auth type="login_failed"
  | stats count AS failures by src_ip
  | where failures > 20
```

## Alerts in cluster mode

In a distributed LynxDB cluster, alerts are automatically distributed across query nodes. This is transparent to users -- you create and manage alerts with the same CLI and API commands regardless of cluster size.

### How cluster alert assignment works

Each alert is assigned to exactly one query node using **rendezvous hashing** (highest random weight). This provides:

- **Exactly-once evaluation**: Each alert runs on exactly one query node, preventing duplicate notifications.
- **Minimal disruption on topology changes**: When a query node joins or leaves, only ~1/N alerts are reassigned. Other alerts continue on their existing nodes.
- **Automatic failover**: When a query node is declared dead (~25 seconds after heartbeats stop), its alerts are automatically reassigned to surviving query nodes.

### Dedup during failover

During failover, there is a brief window where the dying node may have just fired an alert that the new node also evaluates. LynxDB prevents duplicate notifications by storing `LastFiredAt` in the Raft FSM. When an alert is reassigned, the new node checks `LastFiredAt` to avoid re-firing within the same evaluation window.

### Viewing alert assignments

The alert assignment is managed internally by the meta FSM. From the user's perspective, alerts simply work -- you do not need to manually assign alerts to nodes.
